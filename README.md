README: Text Extraction, Categorization, and Questionnaire Pipeline
This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for processing and analyzing patient triage forms. The pipeline consists of several stages, each focused on extracting, categorizing, and converting qualitative data into structured, quantitative data. The stages include text extraction, categorization based on predefined fields, and further analysis through questionnaires assessing psychological and social factors. Below is an overview of each step in the pipeline:

1. Extract Text from Triage Forms
Input: Folder containing .docx triage forms.

Process:

Iterate through each .docx file in the folder.
Extract relevant sections of text between specified markers (e.g., from ‘Additional information’ to ‘Follow-Up Plan’).
Output:

Save the extracted text as individual .txt files.
Alternatively, use in-memory data structures if needed.
Instructions:

Run the extraction script with the following command:
bash
Copy code
python text_extraction.py --input_folder <input_folder_path> --output_folder <output_folder_path>
2. Format Text with Appropriate Columns
Input:

Extracted text from triage forms (in .txt format).
Raw .docx files (if needed for reference).
Process:

Create a structured JSON format with predefined fields such as "Age", "Ethnicity", "Diagnosis", etc.
Ensure the triage forms are correctly parsed and fields are mapped. Handle variations in the structure (e.g., missing fields).
Use ChatGPT to assist with text categorization based on a structured prompt.
Output:

A CSV file containing formatted data from multiple triage forms.
Instructions:

Please ensure that the extracted data is in a format compatible with the tool used for categorization.
Prompt Example for Categorization:

plaintext
Copy code
"I have multiple documents containing patient case details extracted from triage forms, and I need assistance in categorizing the extracted text into specific medical and social categories..."
Fields for Categorization
The fields for categorization are as follows:

Filename
Age
Ethnicity
Gender
Occupation
Past_Psychiatric_History
Past_Admissions_to_IMH
Past_Medical_History

3. Categorize Based on Guidelines (Qualitative to Quantitative)
Input:

Structured CSV containing qualitative data extracted from the triage forms.
Process:

Apply predefined coding rules to convert qualitative data (e.g., symptoms, alcohol consumption, predisposing factors) into quantitative codes.
Retain non-categorized fields (e.g., diagnosis, occupation) in their original form.
Handle missing data by omitting fields that are not applicable.
Use ChatGPT for assistance in categorizing data into predefined numeric codes.
Output:

An updated CSV with numeric codes where applicable.
Instructions:

Follow the coding scheme for each category. For multi-coded fields, return a comma-separated list.

Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)
This questionnaire helps assess the patient's perceived level of social support across various domains: family, friends, and a significant other.

Scale Items (rated on a 5-point Likert scale):

0: Strongly Disagree
1: Disagree
2: NA (neither agree nor disagree)
3: Agree
4: Strongly Agree
Sample Output for MSPSS:
